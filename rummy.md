### Round setup

* Each player gets 10 cards
* Place remaining cards face down in the middle
* Reveal first card and put it next to the pile
    * Unless it's a joker, then shuffle it back into the deck and reveal another card

### Round play
Each player takes turn to either pick up the face up card, or select a card from the pile.
If the current player does not want the face up card, the remaining players have a chance to pick it up ( clockwise priority ). Picking up the face up card when it's not your turn results in an additional punishment card which is taken from the face down pile. The current player then gets a card from the face down pile.

The current player can now put down **all** of the goals for the round on the table infront of themselves.
While putting down the goals of a round, you can buy jokers from goals that were put down by other players. You buy them by swapping them for the card it represents in the other persons goal. The joker can then be used in your goals that you are putting down.

If a player has put down the goals for the round, the player can choose to amend to other goals on the table, not only their own.

The player ends their turn by putting a card in the face up pile.
If the player runs out of cards, the round ends.

### Score counting

Each card is worth their face value except dressed cards which are 10, ace which are 15 and joker which are 25 points.

### Last round `-` + `-` + `-`
The last round is special - all cards in your hand has to be part of your goals, and that each long (-) has to be of a different suit. For the round to end, a player first have to pick up a card either from the face up or face down pile and then fit that card into their goals and then place their goals on the table, no card goes in the face up pile.
